 Audio classification using machine learning

## Goal
Record audio samples and their labels and use them to train ML model using TensorFlow.

## Methods
Sound samples are recorded with respective labels using Python script, which reads serial data from [Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect](https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/nano-rp2040-connect) board. ML model is trained using TensorFlow via Jupyter notebook.
